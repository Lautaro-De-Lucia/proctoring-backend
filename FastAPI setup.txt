#### Creating a virtual environment

On root:

python -m venv fastapienv 

This will create a new directory called fastapienv in your current directory.

To activate the virtual environment, type .\fastapienv\Scripts\activate and press Enter.

(just type 'deactivate' to deactivate it)

Now you are in your virtual enviroment. If you type 'pip list' it will show only two or three 
packages as installed.

#### Installing FastAPI

Once you have activated your virtual environment, you can install FastAPI using pip. 

pip install fastapi

This will install FastAPI along with all its dependencies.

Then install uvicorn (web server for fastAPI)

pip install "uvicorn[standard]"

now if we type 'pip list' it will show more packages

#### Creating a basic FastAPI application 

Create a new file called main.py in your project directory.

Open main.py in your favorite text editor and add the following code:

´´´py
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Hello World"}
´´´

#### Running the application

Finally, you can run your FastAPI application using uvicorn. Here are the steps to run your application:

Open the command prompt and navigate to your project directory.

uvicorn main:app --reload 

This will start the development server.

Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8000/. You should see a message saying “Hello World”.

That’s it! You have successfully set up a basic FastAPI application on Windows.
